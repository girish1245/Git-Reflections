What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When we initialize an exisitng repository we can start committing our files so that the changes are tracked. This will help in version controlling

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

By using staging area, I have finer control over the files that I want to be trackd using git. Instead of commiting all files together, I can add some of them to staging area and commit them later. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I can add multiple files to staging area and commit only what ever I want. 

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Whenever I have an exisitng application that is,
Already updated with most recent version, and If I want to test new features on it, then it makes sense to create a new branch and test it out on the new branch. 

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

I can differentiate between production quality code & experimental code etc by using braches. By seeing diagrams of branches I can understand which brnach has most recent commits etc.
