What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When we initialize an exisitng repository we can start committing our files so that the changes are tracked. This will help in version controlling

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

By using staging area, I have finer control over the files that I want to be trackd using git. Instead of commiting all files together, I can add some of them to staging area and commit them later.
